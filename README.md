# Cleaning and Preparing Time Series Data (MATLAB EXPO 2022)

AI is everywhere, and so is time series data. From manufacturing equipment to automated vehicles, sensors are continuously recording data that can be used for AI powered applications like trend analysis, anomaly detection etc. But quite often, the quality of the data as we receive them, is not ready for analysis or modelling. This demo focuses on how to use MATLAB&reg; to import, explore and prepare time series data for real-world modeling and AI applications. This is part of the MATLAB EXPO 2022 "Cleaning and Preparing Time Series Data" Talk.  It covers both code-based and low-code approach to data cleaning that can be scaled up and deployed.
